Installation instructions.

Copy all the files/directories to your web shared directory in an anubis sub-
directory.

Anubis uses the PDO API to connect to databases, so this feature must be enabled
in your PHP setup. Consult 
http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php
on how to do this.

Edit config.inc.php with the details of your database.
These are the variables:

$dbdatabase - name of data base to connect to.
$dbusername - username to connect with.
$dbpassword - password to connect with.
$dbhost - host to connect to.

To chose which type of database to connect to, set the following to '1' to
select that database:

$db_mysql.
$db_sqlite.

Currently MYSQL and SQLite databases are supported, but to add your own is not
too difficult. Just need to edit anubis_db_connect() and add your specific 
database connection routines. The following URL has a good tutorial on how to 
do this:
